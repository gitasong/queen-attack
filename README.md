The program will determine if the queen can attack an adjacent piece. (This will always be true.)
    Input: ["queen_x" -> 3, "queen_y" -> 4, "other_x" -> 4, "other_y" -> 5]
    Output: "can attack"

The program will determine if the queen can attack horizontally.
    Input: ["queen_x" -> 3, "queen_y" -> 4, "other_x" -> 3, "other_y" -> 8]
    Output: "can attack"

The program will determine if the queen can attack vertically.
    Input: ["queen_x" -> 3, "queen_y" -> 4, "other_x" -> 7, "other_y" -> 4]
    Output: "can attack"

The program will determine if the queen can attack diagonally (NW to SE).
    Input: ["queen_x" -> 3, "queen_y" -> 4, "other_x" -> 4, "other_y" -> 5]
    Output: "can attack"

The program will determine if the queen can attack diagonally (SE to NW).
    Input: ["queen_x" -> 6, "queen_y" -> 5, "other_x" -> 4, "other_y" -> 3]
    Output: "can attack"

The program will determine if the queen can attack diagonally (SW to NE).
    Input: ["queen_x" -> 2, "queen_y" -> 7, "other_x" -> 4, "other_y" -> 5]
    Output: "can attack"

The program will determine if the queen can attack diagonally (NE to SW).
    Input: ["queen_x" -> 8, "queen_y" -> 5, "other_x" -> 6, "other_y" -> 7]
    Output: "can attack"
